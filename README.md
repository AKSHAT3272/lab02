# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object,States or behaviors
* class, A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states
* instance,Allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory.
* method,Collection of statements that are grouped together to manipulate or access information from an objects.
* signature (or heading), method name and the number and type of its parameters. I.e. the following signature changes the size of the instance 'box' of class 'box' and does not give an output.
* ...
* void changeSize(Box box)
* ...
* parameter, an input of the method.I.e.'box' is the parameter in the example above
* type,Defines what values the parameter is allowed to be.
* state,Set of value describing an object.
* source code,Collection of written command that compiles to create an executable program.
* return value,Output of a method
* compiler,Transforms source code into computer language

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0-int
* "hello"-string
* 101-int
* -1-int
* true-boolean
* "33"-string
* 3.1415-float

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
Right click new circle()
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
void send(String pass)
## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
int average(int a,int b)
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.
objects-xPosition,yPosition,colour
## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
Yes an object can implement as many interfaces as needed
