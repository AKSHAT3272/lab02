# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object,States and behaviors
* class, A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states
* instance,Allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory.
* method,Collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation.
* signature, method name and the number and type of its parameters.
* parameter, data that a method can receive
* type,Is the function which decides input parameters
* state,An object's state is defined by the attributes of the object and by the values these have.
* source code,Collection of objects,class and commands
* return value,The header is where you tell Java what value type
* compiler,Transforms source code into computer language

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0-int
* "hello"-string
* 101-int
* -1-int
* true-boolean
* "33"-string
* 3.1415-float

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
Right click new circle()
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
void send()
## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
int average(int a,int b)
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.
objects-xPosition,yPosition,colour
## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
Yes if the object in the class in public.
